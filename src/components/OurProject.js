            BI tools can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes
            unstructured data to help identify, develop, and otherwise create
            new strategic business opportunities. They aim to allow for the easy
            interpretation of these big data. Identifying new opportunities and
            implementing an effective strategy based on insights can provide
            businesses with a competitive market advantage and long-term
            stability, and help them take strategic decisions
